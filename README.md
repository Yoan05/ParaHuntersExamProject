# ParaHuntersExamProject
This is my project for the Java Web course final exam. It is mainly a resell website, but you can post pictures there as well. I decided to change the name from techStore to paraHunters a little too late so the directory is called techStore.

Hunter Code(one of the variables in the UserEntity class) explained: 
	The Hunter Code is a unique code, stored in the ParaHunters' db, which every hunter receives when certified for hunting. Basically it proves you are legitimate and lets you use the website. Some of the hunters are given the admin role through their Hunter Code as well. The problem is that ParaHunters is a fictional organisation, so there are no certificates for hunting and there are no Hunter Codes either. So I simplified the Hunter Code to 1111 for Admin and 0000 for User. If Hunter Codes were real, bans would be much better, because when banned, the hunter gets his Code deleted from the ParaHunters database, thus he is no longer a legitimate hunter and cannot access the website.
